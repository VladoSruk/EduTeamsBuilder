./CreateTeams.ps1 -Prefix "PROINZ_25_" -Description "Project Teams for 2025"
```

### Add Users to Teams
```powershell
./AddUsersToTeams.ps1 -StudentList "data/Example_StudentToTeams_DefaultMember.csv" -Prefix "PROINZ_25_"
```

### Add Users to Group Channels with Roles

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer on Roles
When assigning users to Teams and channels, be careful with role assignments.  
- **Students** should normally be added as *Members*.  
- **Teaching Assistants (TAs) and Demonstrators** are usually added separately and may require *Owner* or other special permissions depending on the course setup.  
It is strongly recommended to double-check the CSV input files and role configurations before running the scripts to avoid misassignments.
